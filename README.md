# CroR-OSIR: Cross-Rejective Open-Set SAR Image Registration
# Introduction
This github project is the code for the paper 《Cross-Rejective Open-Set SAR Image Registration》, which uses Open Set recognition to solve the problem of redundant point pairs in image registration, so we'll show you a visualization and update the code to keep the project up to date！
# Visualization Results
